# Few Shot Learning

```
But letâ€™s define some basic concept first. 
In CIFAR-10, we have 60,000 images in ten different categories. 
In few-shot learning, we train a model with a far larger amount of tasks but far fewer samples per task. 
Our ultimate goal is generalizing knowledge and apply the model to new tasks that even not train before.
