# 1.1 Deterministic And Raandom Models and Variables

Histograms are used to characterise random variables.
To show % of probabilities normalise the values.
  
  e.g If 12 values from a sample of total size 1000
      use 12/1000 as the box height in the histogram.
  This is called a normalised histogram, and each box shows
  the % probability of a random value have the range of values that 
  the box represents.
  
  The total sum of probabilities should be 1.
