# Prephase

  a. Install Firmata
  b. Run basic servo commands from this project
  c. Install opencv
  d. Run basic video recording and capture from this project


# Phase 1

**Learn guesture recognition.**


The idea is simple:

    a. Use a laptop video to capture images of hand guestures
    b. If thumbs up, then a 1 it means 
         * Learn mode,
         * 1 => Hand
         * 2 => Upper arm
         * 3 => Lower arm
         * 4 => Rotate
   
    c. Learn mode should give feedback of a quick 2times movement
       * when hand mode, the hand should open close 2 times
       * upper arm mode, the arm should move up down 2 times
